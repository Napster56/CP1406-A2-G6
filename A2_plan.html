CP1406 - Assignment 2 - Project Plan

Group Name: G6

Group Members: Bonnie Gilsenan, Ben Newbould, Harsh Dhadwal & Tyrone Napoli

Mission Statement:

The purpose of implementing the new website is to improve attendance at concerts of the Barrier Reef Orchestra(BRO) by
increasing ticket sales by XX%. This will be achieved by promoting the Orchestra and its events to a younger audience,
who will then buy tickets to these events. Additionally, the website will promote the membership benefits of the
Barrier Reef Orchestra, and facilitate users to register online.

Success Evaluation:

The success of the website will be measured by the percentage increase in the attendance at concerts. If the increase is
a minimum of XXXX%, then the goal has been achieved.

Additionally, the membership registrations via the online form will be tracked and the percentage increase against the
membership at the time the site goes live will be calculated.
