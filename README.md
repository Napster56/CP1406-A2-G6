This repo contains a Group Website Project for course CP1406 at James Cook Univerity, Cairns.

The project is to (re)develop a site for the Barrier Reef Orchestra (BRO). The current site is located at URL http://nqorchestra.com.au/.

The assignment has two separate milestones as part of this one project:

Milestone 1 - Project Plan & Design Comps (10%, due week 10)
Create a project plan (including goal and audience analysis, flowchart, text, images and screen designs), which your group will continue developing to make the finished site.

Milestone 2 - Finished Product (30%, due week 13)
This is the full, finished product website, the result of your team going through the complete website design and development process. Use the project plan to develop a functional, finished site. Your site should be “completed” by week 12, so that it is ready for usability testing. Assessment of this milestone is for both completeness and quality.
