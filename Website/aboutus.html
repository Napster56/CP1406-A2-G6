    					<h1>History of the Orchestra</h1>
    					<p>
    						Over a two-year period in the late nineties, Townsville musicians, arts workers and a group of people
    						who had a love for music realised the potential for developing a community-based Orchestra — one that
    						would flourish and become an integral part of the City’s cultural life.
    					</p>
    					<p>
    						In 2000 to ‘test’ the viability of establishing an Orchestra a weekend workshop was arranged and
    						musicians were invited to participate under the baton of Richard McIntyre, Senior Lecturer at the
    						Canberra School of Music and the result — the Barrier Reef Orchestra was born.
    					</p>
    					<p>
    						In a typical year the Barrier Reef Orchestra, under the auspices of North Queensland Ensembles Inc,
    						performs three times generally with a guest conductor and occasionally with other performing groups.
    						Smaller ensembles, all utilising players from the Orchestra, regularly give concerts — Orpheus Strings,
    						Pandanus Winds, Kingfisher Trio, Centenary Concert Band and the Barrier Reef Chamber Orchestra.
    					</p>
    					<p>
    						During the next few years the Orchestra performed with the comedy-duo Scared Weird Little Guys in Score,
    						Townsville City Council’s Last Night of the Proms and A Christmas Carol.
    					</p>

  							<p>2015 was our 15 year anniversary and featured several concerts that highlighted not only the
  								enhanced quality of musical performance from the orchestra but an increasing recognition from
  								our audience, benefactors and the wider community.</p>
  							<p>In May BRO was asked to perform at the Townsville ARTS Awards, a first for the orchestra, with a
  								selection from Frozen, not your standard repertoire but well received by the audience and an
  								indication that the orchestra can is and capable of taking on a diverse range of music. This was
  								to be a feature in the last 12 months.</p>
  							<p>August was another first for BRO as were invited to perform at a free public concert as part of
  								the Australian Festival of Chamber Music. Supported by Townsville City Council and featuring
  								other ensembles such as 1RAR band and Camerata of St. John’s string ensemble. The performance
  								culminated in Tchaikovsky’s 1812 Overture Op.49 with a twist. Involving the audience simulating
  								the cannons with paper bags and car keys…. you had to be there. The audience was in excess of
  								4000 and proved very popular. So much so we have been invited back for another performance
  								in 2016. Thank you Justin.</p>
  							<p>As is often the case rehearsals for the World Music Concert were well under way prior to the AFCM
  								concert. World Music Concert offered a music tour of the world featuring Adam Lopez (Vocalist),
  								Domenico Tarraborrelli on Accordion and David Hudson on digeridoo, vocals and guitar.
  								Audio/Visual was used throughout the concert and several of the arrangements were specifically
  								written for the performance. As it involved 21 pieces of music and extra musicians for 1RAR and
  								further afield. Sally our Orchestra Manager had her work cut out for her and I am pleased to say
  								rose to the challenge. I had the privilege to produce direct and conduct the performance. After
  								the performance which was well received by the audience, given the letters and feedback we
  								received, we had a big exhale at completing such a mammoth task.</p>
  							<p>This concert was hired in by Townsville Civic Theatre, another first for BRO. As was our next
  								performance which was a collaboration with Dancenorth in their presentation of a unique work
  								titled Twilight written and directed by Ng Chor Guan an international artist and located on the
  								headlands of Kissing Point. It involved elements of BRO Brass section performing music in
  								response to the environment. With no music written it was up the musicians to play given limited
  								guidelines; certainly a challenge for those of us who are used to using written music. From all
  								reports it was particularly effective.</p>
  							<p>Rounding out the year was A Musical Feast in November conducted by Mark Shiell. Mark commented
  								that he thought the orchestra and improved musically since he last worked with the BRO, pleasing
  								feedback from professional. A potpourri of music that was enjoyed by all. 2016 was soon upon us
  								commencing with the launch at the Pier restaurant with a performance from the Strings and a last
  								minute addition of soprano Siobhan Patrick, a spell binding performance that I think will lead
  								to further collaborations with her. The launch also allowed me to reinforce our Commitment to
  								TPAC www.tpac.net.au) while we had the Mayor’s full attention. This continues to be an ongoing
  								concern that requires all of us to push TPAC forward at every opportunity.</p>

  							<p>The Barrier Reef Orchestra is in a sound financial position with concert attendance and revenue
  								from tickets up for 2013. The Orchestra performed on six occasions over the last 12 months.</p>
  							<p>This included a children’s concert at Riverway featuring music from Harry Potter and Peter and
  								the Wolf. The concert was well received by the audience and the Orchestra got into the mood by
  								dressing up appropriately for their musical characters.</p>
  							<p>Masterworks conducted by Mark Sheills and featuring the 2013 Australian Concerto and Vocal
  								Competition winner was performed in September with a follow up performance in the Burdekin.
  								Sadly the Burdekin concert was not well attended despite the best efforts in advertising and
  								extra signage.</p>
  							<p>Last Night of the Proms was performed in November and conducted by Richard McIntyre. As expected
  								the audience join in with the antics.</p>

  							<p>In 2013, The Barrier Reef Orchestra staged three successful concerts with a total audience of
  								1200 patrons.</p>
  							<p>In March the “Works of Art” concert was a sellout at Riverway. Mussorgsky, Strauss and Haydn with
  								conductor Mario Dobernig was well received by an appreciative audience.</p>
  							<p>In August we had the well named “Contrasts” concert with conductor Raymond Yong and a program
  								varying from Beethoven to Sculthorpe and featuring Elgar’s Cello Concerto with Australian
  								Concerto and Vocal Competition winner Yoshika Masuda. This concert was also presented at the
  								Burdekin Theatre, our first performance at another centre for many years. The concert was also
  								notable for our collaboration with Umbrella Studio and ABC Open which resulted in a photo
  								artists group forming to produce a video of images to accompany Schulthorpe’s Mangrove.</p>
  							<p>We provided an ensemble to play at Anzac Park in September as part of the Bandstand Centenary
  								event and then in October we presented Hats off to Gilbert and Sullivan. This was a quite
  								demanding production devised and conducted by Richard McIntyre and involved 80 singers from
  								North Queensland Opera and Music Theatre and Townsville Choral Society. The chorus combined with
  								a sizable orchestra well and truly filled the Civic stage for what was essentially a Gilbert and
  								Sullivan tribute show featuring excerpts from three operettas tied together by a narrator.</p>
  							<p>2013 saw us maintain our membership numbers and our financial position remained strong. We cover
  								approximately 60% of our expenditure from box office income (which is considered to be very good
  								by not-for-profit arts organisation standards) and the remainder is covered by grants,
  								sponsorship and philanthropy.</p>
  							<p>Over the last five years it has been gratifying to see the Barrier Reef Orchestra make
  								considerable progress. In 2009 the orchestra was in the doldrums. It was drawing an audience of
  								150 or less, had less than $10,000 in cash reserves and performed as an orchestra of about 40
  								players. In fact the mid year concert in 2009 was cancelled because we simply could not muster
  								the players required for the concert program. We are now drawing a audience of 300 to 400 if not
  								more, have cash reserves around $70,000 and field an orchestra of 60 to 70 players, depending on
  								the program.</p>

              </div>
  						<div class="col-12 panel">
  							<p>2012 was a very successful year for the orchestra.</p>
  							<p>We presented three concerts, one at Riverway Arts Centre and two at the Civic Theatre. Each was
  								well received and well patronized – a total of 1,434 patrons between the three concerts. Not
  								only is our audience increasing but so also is the orchestra itself – we have many new players
  								and numbered 65 or more musicians on stage at each concert. Our general membership is also
  								increasing and perhaps reflecting this trend (and the increasing workload) we now have an
  								enthusiastic management committee that is twelve strong. The 2012 concert season was very
  								varied.</p>
  							<p>The March concert was conducted by our artistic director Richard McIntyre and was Russian themed
  								– Prokopiev, Rimsky-Korsakov and Tchaikovsky. It featured Edwina George – the 2011 Australian
  								Concerto and Vocal Competition winner as violin soloist and we also had Sebastien Lipman from
  								Brisbane on harp.</p>
  							<p>In August we had our first concert with Mario Dobernig conducting. Mario has been rehearsing the
  								orchestra for the last couple of days and will conduct the coming March concert and also the two
  								musical interludes which we have for you today.</p>
  							<p>The concert last August featured Beethoven’s Emperor Concerto with Raymond Yong on piano and also
  								the New World Symphony. It was an excellent performance, very well received by the audience who
  								insisted on an encore.
  							<p>
  							<p>The November concert was James Morrison Latin Fiesta. This concert was dreamed up by James
  								Morrison and conductor Sean O’Boyle but is reworked for each performance and had previously been
  								performed with the Queensland, Tasmanian and West Australian Orchestras. Our performance is the
  								only one with a community orchestra. The concert was great fun for both the orchestra and the
  								large audience. It was also particularly pleasing to welcome ten members of 1RAR band who joined
  								us as musical partners in this performance.</p>
