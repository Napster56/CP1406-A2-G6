				<h4 class="alignleft">Performance opportunities for music students.</h4>
                             <p class="alignleft">The Music Centre have a series of Sunday afternoon concerts at C2 and
                                 Friends of the Theatre have regular variety concerts at Pimlico PAC, also on Sunday
                                 afternoons. Because these venues have no foyer space, the theatre has to be open about
                                 an hour before the concert, so that audience members don't have to stand outside in the
                                 sun, wind, and rain.. </p>
                             <p class="alignleft">Instead of playing bland recorded music before the show, we prefer to
                                 have student musicians playing on stage when the doors open.
                                 For the musicians, this is effectively a practice session with a live audience; they
                                 don't have to "perform", they can stop and start as they please. They need to be of
                                 reasonably high standard, but they don't have to be polished performers. About 15
                                 minutes before the concert start time, our compere introduces them, acknowledges the
                                 contribution of their school, and the curtain closes. The students are then welcome to
                                 stay for the concert.</p>
                             <p class="alignleft">The students are considered volunteers, but we can help pay for
                                 expenses incurred.</p>
                             <p class="alignleft">Small instrumental groups are preferred. The offer is open to all
                                 schools, so we need to schedule in advance.</p>
                             <p class="alignleft">FOTT have 6 concerts per year, the Music Centre about 10. </p>
                             <p class="alignleft">If you would like to take part, please let us know so we can send you a
