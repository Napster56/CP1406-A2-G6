<h3>PMI:</h3>

<h4>Pluses:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Experience of working in a team to produce a website based on a real world case</li>
    <li>Ability to get feedback on your own ideas and code from other team members</li>
    <li>Greater range of ideas for design and layout of website</li>
    <li>Improve your own coding skills by reviewing and sharing other team members code</li>
    <li>Ability to divide up tasks based on team members skill sets</li>
    <li>Gain experience with Github working collaboratively as a team </li>

</ul>

<p></p>

<h4>Minuses:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Getting team member to use Slack as method of communication for the project</li>
    <li>Finding suitable time for team meetings that all members are able to attend</li>
    <li>Losing control of the timing for completion; it depends on other team members completing their tasks in time</li>
    <li>Having to reach compromises when team members disagree on an idea for design of website</li>
    <li>Team members who do not engaged with other team members to complete the assignment</li>
    <li>Team members who do not contribute to any code or design ideas</li>
    <li>Team members had issues with pulling and pushing to Github using Github desktop</li>
</ul>

<p></p>

<h4>Interesting aspects:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Trying to understand the motivation, or lack therof, of other team members</li>
    <li>Three team members were engaged and able to work with each other effectively. Unfortunately, one team member
    did not engage, or contribute to the project in a meaningful way.</li>
    <li>As the project progressed into Milestone 2, we realised that our initial plan was too simple; it had to be
        modified to accommodate for the bulletin board and the gallery pages. Perhaps, the team should have spent more
        time in the planning phase, which may have avoided several changes at the last minute.</li>
</ul>
